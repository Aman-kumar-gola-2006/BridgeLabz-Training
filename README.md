# 🔹 Day 3: `this`, `static`, `final` Keywords & `instanceof` Operator

### *(Level 1 Lab Practice)*

---

## 📚 Learning Objectives

* Understood the purpose and usage of the **`this` keyword**:

  * Referring to current class instance variables
  * Differentiating between instance variables and parameters
  * Improving constructor and method clarity

* Learned the **`static` keyword** and its role in:

  * Creating class-level variables and methods
  * Sharing data across all objects of a class

* Gained clarity on the **`final` keyword** and its usage with:

  * Variables (constant values)
  * Methods (preventing method overriding)
  * Classes (preventing inheritance)

* Understood the **`instanceof` operator** to:

  * Check object type at runtime
  * Support safe type casting
  * Apply inheritance-based logic

* Learned to use **Eclipse IDE features** for:

  * Writing clean code
  * Debugging
  * Code formatting
